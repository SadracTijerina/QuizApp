## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** Kotlin
In this project, I used Intents to build multiple activites, as well as to pass data between activites. I also used data classes to layout the structure on how I am going to hold data for each question which was stored in an object file. I also used the progress bar class

## Lessons Learned:
I learned how to use intents and pass data through intents, I also learned about data classes and a purpose for them. as well as I used the progress bar for the first time.


## Examples:
Take a look at these couple examples that I have in my own portfolio:
